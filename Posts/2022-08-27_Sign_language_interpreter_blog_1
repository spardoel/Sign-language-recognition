# Developing a sign language interpreter using machine learning Part 1 - Introduction

First of all, thanks for checking out my Github page! 

My goals for this project are to utilize various machine learning methods for image and video classification. I will start with classification of the American Sign Language alphabet. After that I would like to move to video classification of other sign language words. 

## Dataset
To start I am using the American Sign Language (ASL) Dataset from kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathumarikeri/american-sign-language-09az?resource=download)
The dataset has several thousand images of each letter of the alphabet. The dataset contains about 140 thousand images. Plenty for my purposes.


Not finished... 


## A few things to note
Throughout the blog you may notice that I use the terms Class and Category interchangeably when referring to the different labels in the dataset. 
Personally, I prefer the term Class, but I realize it may be confusing in some contexts and variables cannot be named Class. Hence, I will sometimes use Category.
