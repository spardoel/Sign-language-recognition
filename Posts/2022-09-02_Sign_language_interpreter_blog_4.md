# Developing a sign language interpreter using machine learning Part 4 - Improving the model

When I tested the model in the next post it fell flat on its metaphorical face. 
To try to improve it I made the following changes:
-Increased number of training samples to 1000 per class
-Added 2 more convolutional layers to the network

That's it for now. I wanted to take things slow and only make minor changes between test runs. That way if something worked well (or not) I would know what precisely changed since the last iteration.
